          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Three words to describe me: "Gets things done."</p>
          <p>
            Why I’m here: I became a software engineer because I love to solve
            tough problems and create business value, and software engineering
            presents tons of opportunities to do just that. I’m product-first
            and team-oriented, and I believe the best products are built by
            motivated, self-organizing teams. I work hard, I’m results-driven,
            and I prioritize outcomes over outputs.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s a few of the features you get when we work together:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Expertise building TypeScript, Python, and Node.js applications
            </li>
            <li>
              Extremely fast learner and highly adaptable, can rapidly onboard
              to new domains and technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wealth of expertise across diverse domains: logistics, finance,
              energy, government.
            </li>
            <li>
              Well-versed in building cloud-native applications, both in AWS and
              GCP
            </li>
            <li>Extensive experience with relational databases and SQL</li>
            <li>
              Highly proficient with Linux-based operating systems and Docker
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            What makes me different: I come with a set of non-traditional,
            tech-adjacent skills. I can wrangle data for insights, I can lead
            teams as they navigate conflict or uncertainty, and I can move fast
            in Linux servers and SQL databases. I’m passionate about spreading
            these abilities to my teammates, helping them maximize their own
            effectiveness.
